Description: The dropClust algorithm is used to automatically quantify the
    events of a multiplexed ddPCR reaction. In order to determine the correct
    droplet count for each marker, it is crucial to both identify all clusters and
    label them correctly based on their position. The first approach to cluster the
    ddPCR data is based on the flowDensity algorithm, published in 2012 by M. Jafar
    Taghiyar and Mehrnoush Malek. The second approach is build upon the clustering
    algorithm SamSPECTRAL, a version of spectral clustering adapted to flow
    cytometry data. The third approach uses the flowPeaks package for R, developed
    by Yongchao Ge and Stuart C. Sealfon.
