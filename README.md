# dropClust
##A package for automated quantification of multiplexed ddPCR data.

The dropClust algorithm is used to automatically quantify the events of a multiplexed ddPCR reaction.
In order to determine the correct droplet count for each marker, it is crucial to both identify all clusters and label them correctly based on their position.
To be more robust, three different algorithms for flow cytometry data were adapted and extended in order to analyze ddPCR data.
